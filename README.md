I feel the need to clarify my technical level in PLSQL in short examples of my work. In addition to common script editing, I used to create new packages (insert, update, merge), part of my work was to write datafixes (often using parallels), from the commonly used tools I usually use test window, sql window at PLSQL. At HomeCredit we fix errors at daily load. And keep at least one of us point of contact 24/7, we were worked at different countries with different timezones. All changes at code we saved into SVN or GIT. We always report SLAâ€™s and work was most of the time define by agile approach reported into JIRA.
